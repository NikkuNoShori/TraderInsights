2. **Storage Adapter** (`storage.ts`)
   - Provides cross-environment storage compatibility
   - Works in both browser and Node.js environments
   - Handles in-memory and file-based storage for Node.js
   - Uses localStorage for browser environments

3. **Service Layer** (`webullService.ts`)
   - Implements business logic for WebUll integration
   - Manages authentication state and token refresh
   - Handles data transformation and storage
   - Provides mock data generation for testing

4. **Demo Component** (`WebullDemo.tsx`)
   - Demonstrates the WebUll integration in a React component
   - Provides UI for login, data fetching, and display

   - Provides solutions for common issues
   - Includes debugging tips and error handling information
   - Helps users resolve problems with the integration

## Key Features

1. **Cross-Environment Compatibility**
   - Works in both browser and Node.js environments
   - Automatically detects the environment and uses appropriate storage mechanisms
   - Ensures consistent behavior across different environments

2. **Mock Mode**
   - Provides a mock implementation for development and testing
   - Generates realistic mock data for trades, positions, and account information
   - Allows testing without real credentials

3. **Robust Authentication**
   - Supports username/password authentication
   - Handles MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
   - Manages device IDs for authentication
   - Implements token refresh logic

4. **Data Synchronization**
   - Fetches trades, positions, and account information
   - Transforms data to match internal types
   - Stores data for offline access
   - Tracks last sync time for incremental updates

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implements comprehensive error handling
   - Provides clear error messages
   - Handles network errors, authentication errors, and API errors

## Recent Improvements

1. **Storage Adapter Implementation**
   - Added a storage adapter that works in both browser and Node.js environments
